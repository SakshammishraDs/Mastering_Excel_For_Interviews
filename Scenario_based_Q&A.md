### Error Types: What are common Excel errors, and how do you troubleshoot them?

**Answer:**  
Common Excel errors include:

- **#DIV/0!**: This error occurs when a formula attempts to divide by zero. To troubleshoot, check the denominator of the division operation and ensure it's not zero. You can use the `IFERROR` function to handle this error gracefully by displaying a custom message or alternative value.
- **#VALUE!**: This error usually indicates that a function or operation is expecting a different data type than what is provided. Double-check the data types of the arguments in the formula and ensure they are compatible with the function being used.
- **#REF!**: This error occurs when a cell reference is invalid, typically because a referenced cell or range has been deleted or moved. Review the formula to identify the invalid reference and correct it. You can use the Trace Precedents and Trace Dependents features to track down the source of the error.
- **#NAME?**: This error indicates that Excel doesn't recognize a function or named range referenced in the formula. Check the spelling of the function or named range and ensure it exists in the workbook.
- **#N/A**: This error indicates that a value is not available or cannot be found, often resulting from a lookup operation. Verify the lookup criteria and the data being searched to ensure the desired value exists. You can use the `IFNA` function to handle this error by providing a custom value or message.
- **#NUM!**: This error occurs when a numerical calculation exceeds Excel's capabilities, such as taking the square root of a negative number. Review the formula and the data being used to identify any potential numerical issues.

These common errors can be resolved through careful checks and the use of Excel's error-handling functions like `IFERROR`, `IFNA`, and others.
